Employing Neural_network

Program takes the UKWaC(xml format) raw file and converts it into a required format (data: sensentce seperated by linefeed, pos: pos tags of sentence seperated by linefeed ):
python one.py file > data,pos

Program to prepare word2vec model (word2vec - vector representations of words present in "data" file) based on "data" file:
python trainw2vec.py data data.model

Split data,pos into : train_s,train_p,test_s and test_p (_s- for sentence files and _p - for pos)

To create one hot vector for all pos tags
python tag_vec.py train_p > train_pos_vector
python tag_vec.py test_p > test_pos_vector

Get w2v representation of trigrams
python makev.py train_s > train_wv
python makev.py test_s > test_wv

Program to train neural network to get prediction for test_wv which will be saved in predictionsN.csv
python logcode.py

Program to evaluate for further analysis in form of confusion matrix
python postag_eval.py predictionsN.csv test_pos_vector
